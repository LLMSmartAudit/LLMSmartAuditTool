After reviewing the provided contract code, I have identified a potential vulnerability related to Lack of Gas Limit Considerations.

Lack of Gas Limit Considerations

DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The `forward` function in the `Proxy` contract uses the `delegatecall` function, which allows the called contract to consume all available gas. This can lead to out-of-gas errors and failed transactions if the called contract performs a while loop or any other operation that consumes a large amount of gas. This vulnerability can be exploited by malicious actors to cause denial of service attacks or to prevent the execution of the `forward` function.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION/FIX: To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to add gas limit considerations when using the `delegatecall` function. You can do this by setting an appropriate gas limit when calling the `delegatecall` function. This ensures that the called contract cannot consume all available gas and prevents out-of-gas errors. Additionally, you should carefully review the code of the called contract to ensure that it does not contain any operations that consume a large amount of gas.

Please note that this fix requires modifications to the `Proxy` contract itself.

Thank you for bringing this vulnerability to my attention. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please let me know.
