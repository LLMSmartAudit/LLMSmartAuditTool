Upon reviewing the provided contract code, I have identified a potential vulnerability related to Lack of Restriction on `selfdestruct`. Please find the details below:

Unsafe Suicide Identified.

VULNERABILITY: Lack of Restriction on `selfdestruct`

DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The `Proxy` contract does not implement any access control mechanisms to restrict the usage of the `selfdestruct` function. This can potentially allow anyone to invoke the `selfdestruct` function and destroy the contract, resulting in the loss of contract funds and assets.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement an access control mechanism to restrict the usage of the `selfdestruct` function. One possible approach is to introduce a modifier that checks if the caller is the contract owner before allowing the execution of `selfdestruct`. Here's an example of how this can be implemented:

```solidity
modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner);
    _;
}

function destroy() public onlyOwner {
    selfdestruct(owner);
}
```

By introducing the `onlyOwner` modifier and applying it to the `destroy` function, only the contract owner will be able to invoke the `selfdestruct` function and destroy the contract.

INFO: NO Gas Limit.

Thank you for allowing me to review the contract code. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please let me know.
