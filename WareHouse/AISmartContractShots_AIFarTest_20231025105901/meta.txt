Ideas:
Based on the provided contract code, there are no instances where the order of transaction execution could have an impact on the contract's behavior. The functions in the contract do not involve fund transfers or resource allocation, and there are no scenarios where gas prices can be manipulated to change the order of transaction execution.

Therefore, based on the analysis, there is NO Transactions Order Dependence identified in the contract code.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please let me know.
