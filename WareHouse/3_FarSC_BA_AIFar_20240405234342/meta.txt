Ideas:
 Chief Executive Officer: I agree with your suggestion of adding access control for certain functions by introducing additional modifiers. It would provide more flexibility in managing permissions and roles within the contract. 

Another potential enhancement could be the implementation of a time-based lock mechanism. This would add an extra layer of security by preventing certain functions from being executed until a specific time has passed. It could be useful in scenarios where time-sensitive actions need to be restricted, such as token vesting or time-based voting systems.

Let's continue the discussion and explore the possibilities of these enhancements. Answer their Solidity smart contract ideas in the discussion without any other words, e.g., "A smart contract where we talk about Security: What functions the contract performs"
