Ideas:
 Implementing a time-based payout mechanism would add an additional layer of fairness and structure to the lottery contract. By setting a specific timeframe for the winner to claim their prize, we can ensure that the prize is not left unclaimed indefinitely. If the prize is not claimed within the specified timeframe, it can be forfeited or rolled over to the next lottery. This mechanism would provide clarity and prevent potential disputes or issues related to unclaimed prizes.
