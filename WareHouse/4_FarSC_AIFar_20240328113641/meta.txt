Ideas:
NO Gas Limit.

After reviewing the provided smart contract code, there are no explicit gas limit considerations within the functions. However, the contract does not contain any loops or operations that inherently consume an unpredictable amount of gas that could lead to out-of-gas errors. The functions `deposit` and `withdraw` are straightforward and do not involve any unbounded loops or recursive calls that could potentially consume all the gas provided by a transaction.

Moreover, the contract does not make external calls to unknown contracts or addresses, which could potentially lead to denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities due to gas limit issues. The only external calls made are to the `transferFrom` and `transfer` functions of the IERC20 token interface, which are standard functions and should have a predictable gas cost.

Therefore, based on the current implementation, there are no gas limit vulnerabilities detected in the provided smart contract code. However, it is still recommended to conduct a comprehensive security audit to ensure that all other aspects of the contract are secure and to identify any potential issues that may not be immediately apparent from a static code analysis.
