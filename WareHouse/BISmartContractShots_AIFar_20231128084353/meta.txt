Ideas:
Upon reviewing the provided contract code, I have identified a potential vulnerability related to Gas Limit.

Gas Limit Vulnerability
'''
The `fallback` function in the `Vulnerable` contract uses `delegatecall` to execute the `msg.data` in the `lib` contract. This can lead to a potential gas limit vulnerability if the `lib` contract contains a function that consumes a large amount of gas. Since the `delegatecall` forwards all gas to the called contract, an attacker can craft a malicious `lib` contract that consumes excessive gas, causing the transaction to fail due to out-of-gas error.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement a gas limit check in the `fallback` function of the `Vulnerable` contract. This check should ensure that the gas limit is not exceeded before executing the `delegatecall`. Additionally, it is important to carefully review and audit the `lib` contract to ensure that it does not contain any gas-intensive operations that could be exploited.

Here is an example of how the gas limit check can be implemented in the `fallback` function:

fallback() external payable {
    require(gasleft() > gasLimit, "Gas limit exceeded");
    address(lib).delegatecall(msg.data);
}
'''

Please note that the `gasLimit` variable should be defined and set to an appropriate value that ensures the execution of the `delegatecall` does not exceed the gas limit.

It is crucial to consider gas limit vulnerabilities to prevent potential out-of-gas errors and ensure the smooth execution of transactions.
