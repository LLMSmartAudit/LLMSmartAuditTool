Ideas:
 After reviewing the provided Solidity contract code, we suggest implementing access control mechanisms, input validation, event logging, error handling, a fallback function, and considering the addition of transfer fees, token burning, token freezing, upgradeability, and gas optimization. These enhancements will improve the security, usability, and flexibility of the token contract.
