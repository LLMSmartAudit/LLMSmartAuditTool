 Lack of Gas Limit Considerations.

The provided smart contract, vulnerableBlockHashGame, lacks consideration for gas limit when executing certain functions. This can potentially lead to out-of-gas errors and failed transactions.

To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement gas limit considerations in functions that may consume a significant amount of gas. This can be achieved by using the "gas" keyword in function declarations and specifying an appropriate gas limit.

For example, in the "wasteTime" function, where a while loop is used, it is advisable to include a gas limit to prevent excessive gas consumption. Here's an example of how the function can be modified:

```solidity
function wasteTime() public {
    uint test = uint(block.number);
    uint gasLimit = 100000; // Specify an appropriate gas limit
    while(gasleft() > gasLimit) {
        // Perform the desired operations
    }
}
```

By including gas limit considerations in functions, you can ensure that transactions do not fail due to out-of-gas errors and provide a better user experience.

Please note that this recommendation is specific to the Lack of Gas Limit Considerations vulnerability. It is important to conduct a comprehensive security audit to identify and address other potential vulnerabilities in the smart contract.
