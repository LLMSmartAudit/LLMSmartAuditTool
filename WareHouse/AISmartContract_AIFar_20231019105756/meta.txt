Ideas:
 Implementing a modifier-based access control mechanism to restrict certain functions to authorized users only would enhance the security of the contract. Additionally, adding event logging, error handling, security considerations, gas optimization, and documentation would further improve the contract's functionality, transparency, and efficiency.
