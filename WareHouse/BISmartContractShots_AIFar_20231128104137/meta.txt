Ideas:
REENTRANCY VULNERABILITY
'''
The `WithdrawToHolder` function in the `TokenBank` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. This function directly calls `_addr.call.value(_wei)` without updating the holder's balance first, which can be exploited by a malicious contract to re-enter the `WithdrawToHolder` function and withdraw more Ether than the holder is entitled to.

To mitigate this, the contract should follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern. The balance of the holder should be updated (effect) before the external call (interaction) is made to transfer Ether. Here's the recommended change:

function WithdrawToHolder(address _addr, uint _wei) public onlyOwner payable {
    if(Holders[_addr] >= _wei){
        Holders[_addr] -= _wei; // Update the balance first
        _addr.call.value(_wei)(); // Then transfer Ether
    }
}
'''

UNSAFE EXTERNAL CALL
'''
The `WithdrawToken` function in the `Token` contract uses `token.call` with arbitrary data, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the target address is not a token contract or is a malicious contract. This pattern of invoking functions is also deprecated and should be replaced with a safer alternative.

To mitigate this, the contract should use the `transfer` function provided by the ERC20 standard or at least use `require` to ensure that the call was successful:

function WithdrawToken(address token, uint256 amount, address to) public onlyOwner {
    require(ERC20(token).transfer(to, amount), "Transfer failed");
}
'''

MISSING INPUT VALIDATION
'''
The `changeOwner` and `confirmOwner` functions in the `Ownable` contract do not validate the input address, allowing the owner to be set to the zero address (0x0), which can lead to a loss of contract control.

To mitigate this, the contract should include a check to ensure that the new owner's address is not the zero address:

function changeOwner(address addr) public onlyOwner {
    require(addr != address(0), "New owner cannot be the zero address");
    newOwner = addr;
}

function confirmOwner() public {
    require(msg.sender == newOwner, "Only the new owner can call this function");
    require(newOwner != address(0), "New owner cannot be the zero address");
    owner = newOwner;
}
'''

INCORRECT MODIFIER USAGE
'''
The `onlyOwner` modifier in the `Ownable` contract is incorrectly implemented. It lacks the required `;` at the end of the `if` statement, which will cause a compilation error.

To mitigate this, the modifier should be correctly formatted with the semicolon:

modifier onlyOwner {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner is allowed to perform this action");
    _;
}
'''

LACK OF EVENT LOGGING
'''
The contract does not emit any events for critical actions such as ownership transfer, deposits, or withdrawals. This makes it difficult to track these actions on the blockchain.

To mitigate this, the contract should include event definitions and emit events for these actions:

event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);
event Deposited(address indexed depositor, uint256 amount);
event Withdrawn(address indexed recipient, uint256 amount);

// Emit events in the respective functions
'''

Given the above vulnerabilities and recommendations, the contracts need to be carefully reviewed and updated to ensure security and proper functionality. However, since the task specifies no upgrade code, the recommendations provided do not include any new code but rather modifications to the existing code to address the identified issues.
