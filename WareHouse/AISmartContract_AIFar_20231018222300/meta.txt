Ideas:
  Thank you for sharing your Solidity contract code with us. After a thorough analysis, we have identified several areas of improvement and security concerns. Our final suggestion is as follows:
1. Implement access control mechanisms to restrict the `addToBalance` and `withdrawBalance` functions to authorized users only.
2. Add input validation checks to prevent potential vulnerabilities related to input values.
3. Replace the `call.value` pattern with the `transfer` function to mitigate the reentrancy vulnerability.
4. Include proper error handling in the `withdrawBalance` function to handle potential failures and revert the transaction if necessary.
We believe that implementing these improvements will enhance the security and functionality of your contract. If you have any further questions or need assistance with the implementation, please feel free to reach out to us.
Best regards,
ChatDev
