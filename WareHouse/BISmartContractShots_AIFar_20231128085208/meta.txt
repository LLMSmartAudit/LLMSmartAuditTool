Upon reviewing the provided contract code, I have identified a vulnerability related to Lack of Restriction on `selfdestruct`. Here are the details:

Unsafe Suicide Identified.

VULNERABILITY: Lack of Restriction on `selfdestruct`

DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The contract code does not include any access control mechanisms to restrict the usage of the `selfdestruct` function. This means that anyone can call the `selfdestruct` function and potentially destroy the contract, resulting in the loss of contract funds.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: To mitigate this vulnerability, it is crucial to implement strong access control mechanisms to restrict the usage of the `selfdestruct` function. One approach is to modify the `Ownable` contract to include a modifier that only allows the contract owner to call the `selfdestruct` function. Here's an example of how the modification can be made:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract Ownable {
    address public owner;

    function Ownable() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        _;
    }

    function changeOwner(address newOwner) public onlyOwner {
        require(newOwner != address(0));
        owner = newOwner;
    }

    function selfDestruct() public onlyOwner {
        selfdestruct(owner);
    }
}

```

By adding the `onlyOwner` modifier to the `selfDestruct` function, only the contract owner will have permission to destroy the contract.

Please note that this vulnerability is specific to the Lack of Restriction on `selfdestruct` and does not cover other potential security issues that may exist in the contract code. It is essential to conduct a comprehensive security audit to identify and address any additional vulnerabilities.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please let me know.
