Upon reviewing the provided contract code, I have identified a vulnerability related to Gas Limit.

Gas Limit Identified.

VULNERABILITY: Lack of gas limit considerations

DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The contract code does not consider the gas limit when executing the `deposit` and `transferTo` functions. This can potentially lead to out-of-gas errors and failed transactions if the gas required exceeds the gas limit set by the user or the network. Additionally, the `transferTo` function performs an external call to the `to.transfer(amount)` statement, which can consume a significant amount of gas if the recipient address has a fallback function that performs a large number of operations. This can also lead to out-of-gas errors and failed transactions.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to add gas limit considerations to the `deposit` and `transferTo` functions. This can be achieved by using the `require` statement to check the remaining gas before executing any operations that consume gas. If the remaining gas is not sufficient, the function should revert the transaction and return any gas consumed. Additionally, it is important to carefully review and optimize the gas usage of the contract to minimize the risk of out-of-gas errors.

Please note that the provided contract code includes a Lack of gas limit considerations vulnerability. It is crucial to address this vulnerability by implementing the recommended mitigation.

If you have any further questions or require additional assistance, please let me know.
