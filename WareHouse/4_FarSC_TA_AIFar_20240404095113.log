[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Security Analyst. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and share a common interest in collaborating to successfully execute a marketing strategy for a new customer.
You can leverage your knowledge of Ethereum smart contracts and security best practices to throughly review the privded vulnerable smart contracts and identify potential bugs and security vulnerablites
Here is a new customer's task: .
To complete the task,  you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Given the user's task and the brainstorming ideas provided:
Task: "".
Ideas: " No Integer Overflow/Underflow.".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Reentrancy attacks. Reentrancy attacks occurs when an attacker can create a malicious contract that calls some function repeatedly before the balance is updated, allowing them to drain the contract's funds. It does not follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern
If you identify Reentrancy vulnerability, please respond with: "<INFO> Reentrancy Identified."
For each vulnerability identified, use the following format:
```
VULNERABILITY NAME or TYPE
'''
DETAILED DESCRIPTION of the vulnerability, AND recommended mitigation/fix with no upgrade code
'''
```
If you don't find any vulnerabilities, respond only with: "<INFO> No Reentrancy."
