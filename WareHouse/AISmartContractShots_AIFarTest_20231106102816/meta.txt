 Gas Limit.

Gas Limit vulnerabilities have been identified in the provided smart contract code. Here are the details:

Gas Limit Vulnerability
'''
The contract does not consider the gas limit when executing the `transferTo` function. This function uses `to.transfer(amount)` to transfer Ether to the specified address. However, if the recipient address is a contract with a fallback function that consumes a large amount of gas, the transaction may fail due to out-of-gas errors.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should consider using the `call` function instead of `transfer` and implement a gas limit check. This will allow you to specify a maximum amount of gas to be used for the external call, preventing potential out-of-gas errors. Additionally, you should handle any exceptions or errors that may occur during the external call.

Here's an example of how you can modify the `transferTo` function to include a gas limit check:

function transferTo(address payable to, uint amount) public payable {
    require(tx.origin == owner);
    require(gasleft() >= gasLimit); // Add a gas limit check

    (bool success, ) = to.call{value: amount, gas: gasLimit}(""); // Use call with gas limit
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
}
'''

Please note that the gas limit value (`gasLimit`) should be carefully chosen to ensure that it is sufficient for the intended operation but not excessive to avoid potential abuse.

It is important to thoroughly test and audit the modified code to ensure its correctness and security.

Let me know if you need any further assistance or have any other concerns.
