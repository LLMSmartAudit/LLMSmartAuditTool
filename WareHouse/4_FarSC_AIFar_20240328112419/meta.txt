Ideas:
After reviewing the provided smart contract code, I have identified a potential vulnerability related to the gas limit. Here is the detailed description and recommended mitigation:

REENTRANCY VULNERABILITY
'''
The contract's `swap` function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack because it interacts with external contracts (IERC20 token contracts) by calling `transferFrom` and `transfer` before updating the contract's state (`pools` mapping). A malicious token contract could call back into the `swap` function while `transferFrom` or `transfer` is being executed, potentially leading to unexpected behavior such as draining funds from the pool.

To mitigate this issue, the contract should follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. This means that it should perform all checks (e.g., require statements), make all state changes, and then perform interactions with external contracts. Here is the recommended change:

1. Update the state (`pools` mapping) before calling the external `transferFrom` and `transfer` functions.
2. Use a reentrancy guard modifier that prevents nested (reentrant) calls to the `swap` function.

Here is an example of how to implement a reentrancy guard:

```solidity
bool private locked;

modifier noReentrancy() {
    require(!locked, "No reentrancy");
    locked = true;
    _;
    locked = false;
}

function swap(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint256 amountIn, uint256 minAmountOut) public noReentrancy {
    // existing code with state updates before external calls
}
```

By applying this pattern, the contract will be protected against reentrancy attacks, which can also cause issues with gas limits if the attacker causes recursive calls until the transaction runs out of gas.
'''

Please note that while this vulnerability is not directly related to gas limit considerations or DoS attacks as described in the brainstorming ideas, it is a critical security issue that can affect the contract's integrity and should be addressed.
