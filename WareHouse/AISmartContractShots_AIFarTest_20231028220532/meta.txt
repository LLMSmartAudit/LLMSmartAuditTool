 Lack of Gas Limit Considerations.

The provided smart contract code does not consider the gas limit when executing the `setFibonacci` function in the `FibonacciLib` contract. This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the Fibonacci number, which can potentially lead to out-of-gas errors and failed transactions if the input value `n` is too large.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you can consider implementing an iterative approach to calculate the Fibonacci number instead of a recursive one. This will ensure that the function does not consume excessive gas and can be executed within the gas limit.

Here's an example of an iterative Fibonacci function that you can use:

```solidity
function fibonacci(uint n) internal returns (uint) {
    if (n == 0) return start;
    else if (n == 1) return start + 1;
    
    uint a = start;
    uint b = start + 1;
    uint result;
    
    for (uint i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        result = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = result;
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

By using an iterative approach, the `setFibonacci` function will be able to calculate the Fibonacci number without consuming excessive gas and causing out-of-gas errors.

Please note that this fix does not require any upgrade code, as it can be implemented within the existing contract code.
