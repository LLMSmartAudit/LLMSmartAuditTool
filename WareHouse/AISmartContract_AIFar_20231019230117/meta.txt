Ideas:
 The final enhancement suggestion for the provided Solidity contract code is to implement an event system to improve transparency and allow for easier tracking of contract events. By emitting events at key points in the contract's execution, users and external systems can easily monitor and react to important contract actions. This can be achieved by adding `event` declarations and emitting events using the `emit` keyword in appropriate functions, such as `changeOwner`, `WithdrawToken`, and `WithdrawToHolder`. The event data can include relevant information such as the address of the sender, the amount transferred, and any other relevant details. Implementing an event system will enhance the contract's usability and provide a better user experience.
