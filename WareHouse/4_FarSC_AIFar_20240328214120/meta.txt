 Gas Limit.

```
UNBOUNDED LOOPS
'''
The functions dripETH(), dropETH(), and customDropETH() iterate over the entire members array without any restriction on its size. This could lead to out-of-gas errors if the array grows too large, as the amount of gas required to execute the loop would exceed the block gas limit. This not only could cause the transaction to fail but also could be exploited by an attacker to perform a denial-of-service attack by front-running transactions to add a large number of members, making it impossible to distribute funds.

To mitigate this issue, consider implementing a withdrawal pattern where each member can individually withdraw their allocated funds. This removes the need for iterating over all members in a single transaction and reduces the risk of hitting the gas limit. Additionally, you could set a cap on the number of members to ensure that the loops will not exceed the gas limit.

```
DoS WITH BLOCK GAS LIMIT
'''
The customDropETH() function allows the secretary to specify an array of drop amounts for each member. If the array of drop amounts is large enough, the transaction could require more gas than the block gas limit, effectively making it impossible to execute. This could be used by a malicious secretary to lock funds within the contract by setting extremely high drop amounts for a large number of members.

To mitigate this, you could implement a check to ensure that the sum of all drops does not exceed the balance of the contract. Additionally, similar to the above mitigation, consider using a withdrawal pattern to avoid the need for iterating over a potentially large array in a single transaction.
