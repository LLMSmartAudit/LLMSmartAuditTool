Ideas:
After reviewing the provided contract code, I have identified a potential vulnerability related to Transactions Order Dependence.

In the `Collect` function, the contract checks if the balance of the sender is greater than or equal to both the minimum sum (`MinSum`) and the requested amount (`_am`). If both conditions are met, the contract transfers the requested amount to the sender using `msg.sender.call.value(_am)()`.

However, this implementation is susceptible to a reentrancy attack. An attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `Collect` function repeatedly before the balance is updated, allowing them to drain the entire balance of the sender.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should consider implementing the checks-effects-interactions pattern. This pattern involves performing all necessary checks and updating the contract state before interacting with external contracts or transferring funds. By doing so, you can prevent reentrancy attacks.

To address this issue, you can modify the `Collect` function as follows:

```solidity
function Collect(uint _am) public payable {
    if (balances[msg.sender] >= MinSum && balances[msg.sender] >= _am) {
        balances[msg.sender] -= _am;
        Log.AddMessage(msg.sender, _am, "Collect");
        
        // Perform interactions after updating contract state
        if (!msg.sender.call.value(_am)()) {
            revert();
        }
    }
}
```

By updating the contract state before interacting with `msg.sender`, you can prevent reentrancy attacks and ensure the security of the contract.

Please note that this is just one potential vulnerability I have identified. It is crucial to conduct a comprehensive security audit to identify and address any other potential vulnerabilities in the contract code.
