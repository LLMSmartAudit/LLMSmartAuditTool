Task: "".
Ideas: "As the Security Analyst, I would need to see the actual Solidity smart contract code to perform a thorough review for integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities. Since the code has not been provided, I am unable to proceed with the analysis.

To move forward, please provide the smart contract code that you would like to have reviewed. Once I have the code, I can analyze it for the specific vulnerabilities you are concerned about, including integer overflow/underflow, and provide detailed feedback and recommendations for mitigation without the need for upgradeable code.

If you can share the contract code, I will be able to give you a detailed report on any potential vulnerabilities found.".
As the Security Analyst, your primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the provided contract code, with a particular focus on identifying vulnerabilities related to Reentrancy attacks. Reentrancy attacks occurs when an attacker can create a malicious contract that calls some function repeatedly before the balance is updated, allowing them to drain the contract's funds. It does not follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern
If you identify Reentrancy vulnerability, please respond with: "<INFO> Reentrancy Identified."
For each vulnerability identified, use the following format:
```
VULNERABILITY NAME or TYPE
'''
DETAILED DESCRIPTION of the vulnerability, AND recommended mitigation/fix with no upgrade code
'''
```
If you don't find any vulnerabilities, respond only with: "<INFO> No Reentrancy."
