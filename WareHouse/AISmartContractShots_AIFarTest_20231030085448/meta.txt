Ideas:
NO Gas Limit.

After reviewing the provided smart contract code, I did not find any vulnerabilities related to Gas Limit. The contract code appears to be well-implemented and does not contain any gas limit considerations or potential denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities.

However, I would like to highlight a few other potential security concerns that you may want to consider:

1. Lack of Input Validation: The contract does not validate the input provided by the players. It is important to ensure that the input is within the expected range and format to prevent any unexpected behavior or manipulation.

2. Lack of Access Control: The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to specific roles or addresses. Consider implementing access control to ensure that only authorized users can execute certain functions.

3. Use of "throw" Statement: The use of the "throw" statement is deprecated in newer versions of Solidity. It is recommended to use the "revert" statement instead, which provides more detailed error messages and better handling of gas refunds.

4. Lack of Event Logging: It is a good practice to log important events in the contract using events. This can help with contract debugging and provide transparency to users.

Please consider these recommendations to enhance the security and functionality of the smart contract. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like assistance in implementing these improvements.
