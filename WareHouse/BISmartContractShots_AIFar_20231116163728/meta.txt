 Gas Limit.

VULNERABILITY: Denial-of-Service (DoS) with Unchecked CALL
'''
The `transferTo` function uses the `transfer` function to send Ether. The `transfer` function forwards only a limited gas stipend (2300 gas), which is not enough to perform more complex operations in the fallback function of the receiving contract. If the receiving contract's fallback function consumes more than 2300 gas, the `transfer` call will fail, potentially locking funds in the contract.

To mitigate this, it's recommended to replace the `transfer` function with the `call{value: amount}("")` function, which forwards all available gas to the receiving contract. However, be aware that this can potentially enable reentrancy attacks if not properly protected. Therefore, it's crucial to follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern and ensure that the contract state is updated before calling external contracts.

VULNERABILITY: Potential Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack
'''
The `transferTo` function requires the transaction origin (`tx.origin`) to be the contract owner. This can potentially enable a DoS attack if the contract owner is a contract with a fallback function that consumes a lot of gas. The `tx.origin` check will pass, but the `transfer` call may fail due to out-of-gas errors, making the `transferTo` function unusable.

To mitigate this, it's recommended to replace the `tx.origin` check with a `msg.sender` check. The `msg.sender` value is the direct caller of the function, which is more secure and less prone to potential attacks. Also, consider implementing a gas limit check or other mechanisms to prevent DoS attacks.
