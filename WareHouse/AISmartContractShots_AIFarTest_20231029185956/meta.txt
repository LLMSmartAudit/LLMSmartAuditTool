 NO Gas Limit.

After reviewing the provided smart contract code, I did not find any instances of vulnerabilities related to Gas Limit. The contract appears to be free from these particular vulnerabilities.

However, I would like to point out that the contract lacks a return type for the `run` function. To ensure code clarity and adherence to best practices, it is recommended to explicitly specify the return type of the function. For example, you can specify `function run(uint256 input) public returns (bool)` if the function is intended to return a boolean value.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there are any other aspects of the contract that you would like me to review.
