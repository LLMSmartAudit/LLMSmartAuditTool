Ideas:
Upon reviewing the provided contract code, I have identified a potential vulnerability related to Transactions Order Dependence. 

In the `Collect` function, the contract checks if the balance of the sender is greater than or equal to both the minimum sum (`MinSum`) and the amount to be collected (`_am`). However, the contract does not enforce a specific order of execution for these conditions. This means that an attacker could potentially manipulate the order of transactions to bypass the check for the minimum sum and collect funds without meeting the required balance.

To mitigate this vulnerability, I recommend modifying the `Collect` function to enforce a specific order of execution for the balance checks. One possible solution is to first check if the balance is greater than or equal to the minimum sum and then check if it is also greater than or equal to the amount to be collected.

Here's an updated version of the `Collect` function that addresses this vulnerability:

```solidity
function Collect(uint _am) public payable {
    if (balances[msg.sender] >= MinSum) {
        if (balances[msg.sender] >= _am) {
            if (msg.sender.call.value(_am)()) {
                balances[msg.sender] -= _am;
                Log.AddMessage(msg.sender, _am, "Collect");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

By enforcing the order of execution for the balance checks, we ensure that the minimum sum requirement is always checked before the amount to be collected.

Please note that this is just one possible solution, and further analysis and testing may be required to ensure the contract's security. Additionally, it's important to consider other potential vulnerabilities and conduct a comprehensive security audit of the entire contract code.
