 Lack of Gas Limit Considerations.

Lack of Gas Limit Considerations
'''
The contract does not consider the gas limit when executing the sendToWinner() and withdrawLeftOver() functions. This can lead to out-of-gas errors and failed transactions if the execution of these functions consumes more gas than the block gas limit allows.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should consider implementing a gas limit check before executing any potentially gas-consuming operations. This can be done by using the gasleft() function to check the remaining gas and comparing it against a predefined threshold. If the remaining gas is below the threshold, the function should gracefully handle the situation, such as reverting the transaction or providing an error message to the user.

Here's an example of how you can implement a gas limit check in the sendToWinner() function:

function sendToWinner() public {
    require(!payedOut);
    require(gasleft() >= GAS_THRESHOLD); // Add this gas limit check

    winner.send(winAmount);
    payedOut = true;
}

Remember to define the GAS_THRESHOLD constant appropriately based on your gas consumption analysis and the desired gas limit for the execution of these functions.
