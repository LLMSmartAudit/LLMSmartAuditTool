Ideas:
After reviewing the provided contract code, I have identified a potential vulnerability related to the usage of `delegatecall` in the `multiDelegatecall` function.

Potential vulnerability: Delegatecall to untrusted contracts
'''
The `multiDelegatecall` function uses `delegatecall` to execute external contract code provided in the `data` parameter. This can be potentially dangerous if the `data` parameter allows arbitrary contract code execution. If the `data` parameter is controlled by an attacker, they can execute malicious code in the context of the `MultiDelegatecall` contract, which can lead to unauthorized access, manipulation of contract state, or loss of funds.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to carefully validate and sanitize the `data` parameter before executing the `delegatecall`. Ensure that only trusted and verified contract addresses are allowed to be called using `delegatecall`. Additionally, consider implementing access control mechanisms to restrict the execution of `delegatecall` to authorized parties only.

In the provided contract code, there is no explicit validation or sanitization of the `data` parameter before executing the `delegatecall`. This can potentially allow arbitrary contract code execution, which is a security risk.
