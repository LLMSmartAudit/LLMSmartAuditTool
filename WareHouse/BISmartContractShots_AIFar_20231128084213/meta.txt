Ideas:
After reviewing the provided smart contract code, I have identified that there is a potential vulnerability related to Gas Limit.

Gas Limit Vulnerability
'''
The `multiDelegatecall` function in the `MultiDelegatecall` contract does not consider the gas limit when executing the delegatecall. This can lead to out-of-gas errors and failed transactions if the delegatecall consumes more gas than the block gas limit allows.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to add gas limit considerations when executing the delegatecall. You can use the `gasleft()` function to check the remaining gas and ensure that it is sufficient for the delegatecall. If the remaining gas is not enough, you can either revert the transaction or handle the error gracefully.

Here's an example of how you can add gas limit considerations:

(bool ok, bytes memory res) = address(this).delegatecall{gas: gasleft()}(data[i]);

By specifying `gas: gasleft()`, you ensure that the delegatecall uses the remaining gas available in the transaction.

It is important to carefully consider the gas limit and ensure that it is set to a reasonable value to prevent potential DoS attacks or excessive gas consumption.

Please note that this fix does not require any upgrade to the contract code.
