Ideas:
 I agree with the final idea you proposed. Implementing access control mechanisms using modifiers or role-based access control, using the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations, emitting events for important contract actions, and implementing a withdrawal pattern are all valuable enhancements to the contract code. These improvements will enhance the security, integrity, and transparency of the contract. Let's proceed with sharing this final idea with the user.
