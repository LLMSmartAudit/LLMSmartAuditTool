Ideas:
 I suggest adding access control mechanisms to restrict the execution of delegatecall only to authorized callers in the "Vulnerable" contract. This can be achieved by implementing a modifier that checks the caller's address before allowing the delegatecall to execute. By doing so, we can prevent unauthorized execution of arbitrary functions on the "lib" contract. Additionally, we should review the "Lib" contract for any potential vulnerabilities or issues to ensure overall security.
