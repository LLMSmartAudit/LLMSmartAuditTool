 Gas Limit.

VULNERABILITY NAME or TYPE
```
Unbounded Loops
'''
DETAILED DESCRIPTION of the vulnerability, AND recommended mitigation/fix with no upgrade code
The functions `sendPrize` and `claimPrize` iterate over arrays without any bounds on their size. This can lead to out-of-gas errors if the arrays grow too large, as the amount of gas required to execute the loop increases with the number of iterations. This could be exploited by a malicious user who could send a large number of tokens to the contract, making it impossible for the `claimPrize` function to be executed successfully due to the block gas limit.

To mitigate this issue, consider implementing a pattern that processes elements in smaller batches. This could be done by keeping track of an index and allowing users to process a fixed number of elements per transaction. Alternatively, you could set a maximum limit on the number of elements that can be processed in a single transaction.

VULNERABILITY NAME or TYPE
```
DoS with Block Gas Limit
'''
DETAILED DESCRIPTION of the vulnerability, AND recommended mitigation/fix with no upgrade code
The `sendPrize` function allows a user to add an arbitrary number of tokens to the `prizeTokens` and `prizeTokensId` arrays. There is no check on the length of these arrays. A malicious user could call `sendPrize` with a very large array of tokens, which would require a large amount of gas to iterate through. This could prevent other users from calling the `claimPrize` function if the gas required to iterate through the arrays exceeds the block gas limit, effectively causing a denial-of-service condition.

To mitigate this, you could enforce a maximum array size for the `tokens` and `tokensId` parameters in the `sendPrize` function. This would prevent an attacker from adding too many tokens in a single transaction and ensure that the `claimPrize` function remains below the block gas limit.
