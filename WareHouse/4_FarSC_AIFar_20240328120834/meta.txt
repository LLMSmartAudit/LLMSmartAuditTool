Ideas:
NO Gas Limit.

The provided smart contract code is a standard implementation of an `Ownable` abstract contract, which is a common pattern used in Ethereum smart contracts to restrict access to certain functions to the owner of the contract. The contract includes basic functions for ownership transfer and renouncement.

After reviewing the provided code, there are no functions that include loops or unbounded operations that could potentially consume an excessive amount of gas. All functions are straightforward, with fixed execution paths that do not depend on external input or state that could lead to variable gas consumption. The contract does not make external calls that could introduce gas limit issues either.

Additionally, there are no functions that could be used to perform denial-of-service attacks through gas exhaustion. The only functions that modify the state (`renounceOwnership` and `transferOwnership`) are protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, ensuring that only the current owner can call them. This limits the risk of any malicious attempts to disrupt the contract's availability through resource-intensive operations.

Therefore, based on the provided code and the scope of the review focused on gas limit considerations, there are no gas limit vulnerabilities present in the contract. The contract's simplicity and the absence of complex operations or external calls contribute to this assessment. However, it is important to note that this review is limited to the code provided and does not account for any additional functionality that may be present in the full contract or system in which this contract would be integrated.
