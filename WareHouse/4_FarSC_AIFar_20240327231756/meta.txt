Ideas:
 To address the issues identified, we could consider the following enhancements:

1. **Replace `now` for Randomness**: Implement a commit-reveal scheme or use an external oracle to provide randomness that is not manipulable by miners or observable on-chain before betting.
   
2. **Protect `secretNumber`**: Change the game mechanics so that the `secretNumber` does not need to be stored on-chain, or ensure it is only set and revealed in a secure manner that does not compromise the game's fairness.

3. **Update `suicide` to `selfdestruct`**: Replace the `suicide` function with `selfdestruct` to adhere to the latest Solidity standards and implement a secure withdrawal function to allow players to retrieve their funds before the contract is destroyed.

4. **Implement Check-Effects-Interactions Pattern**: Ensure that state changes are made before calling external contracts to prevent re-entrancy attacks and potential loss of funds.

5. **Use Withdrawal Pattern**: Implement a withdrawal pattern to allow winners to pull their winnings from the contract, reducing the security risks associated with pushing funds to external addresses.

6. **Limit Number of Bets**: Introduce a limit on the number of bets per block or per address to prevent spamming and potential denial of service.

7. **Emit Events**: Add event logging for key actions like placing a bet or shuffling to enable off-chain applications to monitor contract activity.

8. **Limit Disclosure of Contract Balance**: Keep the balance that is available for winning separate and only disclose the amount that can be won, not the entire contract balance.

9. **Update Compiler Version**: Use the latest stable version of the Solidity compiler to benefit from the latest security features and optimizations.

10. **Refine Fallback Function**: Add logic to the fallback function to handle unexpected Ether or reject plain Ether transfers that are not part of the game mechanics.

11. **Set Betting Limits**: Introduce maximum bet limits to prevent overly risky bets and potential depletion of contract funds.

12. **Ownership Transfer Mechanism**: Implement an ownership transfer function to allow the current owner to transfer control of the contract to a new owner securely.

By implementing these suggestions, we can significantly improve the security and robustness of the EthRoulette contract.
