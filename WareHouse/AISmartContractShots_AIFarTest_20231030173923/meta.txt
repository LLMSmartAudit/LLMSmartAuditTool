Ideas:
After reviewing the provided smart contract code, I have identified a potential vulnerability related to Gas Limit.

Gas Limit Vulnerability
'''
The contract does not include any gas limit checks or other mechanisms to prevent DoS attacks. This can allow malicious actors to perform resource-intensive operations, leading to network congestion or contract unavailability.
'''

To mitigate this vulnerability, I recommend implementing gas limit checks in critical functions that involve potentially resource-intensive operations. This can be done by using the `gasleft()` function to check the remaining gas and comparing it against a predefined threshold. If the remaining gas is below the threshold, the function should revert the transaction to prevent DoS attacks.

Here is an example of how the gas limit check can be implemented in the `delegate` function:

```
function delegate(address to) public {
    Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
    require(!sender.voted);
    require(to != msg.sender);

    // Gas limit check
    require(gasleft() > gasThreshold);

    while (voters[to].delegate != address(0) && voters[to].delegate != msg.sender) {
        to = voters[to].delegate;
    }
    require(to != msg.sender);

    sender.voted = true;
    sender.delegate = to;
    Voter storage delegateTo = voters[to];
    if (delegateTo.voted) {
        proposals[delegateTo.vote].voteCount += sender.weight;
    } else {
        delegateTo.weight += sender.weight;
    }
}
```

By implementing gas limit checks in critical functions, the contract can prevent potential DoS attacks and ensure the availability of the contract.

If you have any other concerns or need further assistance, please let me know.
