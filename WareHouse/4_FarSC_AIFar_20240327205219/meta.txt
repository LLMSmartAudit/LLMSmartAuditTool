Ideas:
 Certainly, let's refine the suggestions for the Solidity smart contract:

1. Replace `throw` with `require` for pre-condition checks and `revert` for reverting the transaction with an error message.
2. Introduce a constant for the ether play amount and document it, or create a function to update this value by the owner.
3. Add validation for the `number` input in the `play` function to ensure it meets the game's requirements.
4. Replace `send` with `transfer` for ether transfers, or use `call` in combination with proper error handling.
5. Implement a check for the success of ether transfers and handle the failure case to prevent DoS attacks.
6. Add a check to prevent the same player from playing twice in a row.
7. Ensure the `tot` variable is reset to 0 in all cases where the game state is reset.
8. Emit events for game actions such as playing and winning to enable front-end interaction and increase transparency.
9. Consider implementing a contract upgrade mechanism using proxies or similar patterns for future improvements.
10. Clarify the rules for the remaining balance (e.g., 200 finney) and implement proper accounting for it.
11. Update the Solidity version to the latest stable release to take advantage of recent features and security enhancements.
12. Add a check in the `play` function to ensure that the game does not exceed the maximum player count before adding a new player.

Once we agree on these enhancements, we can conclude with a final proposal.
