Ideas:
Upon reviewing the provided smart contract code, I have identified a vulnerability related to Lack of Gas Limit Considerations.

VULNERABILITY: Lack of Gas Limit Considerations
'''
The contract does not consider the gas limit when executing the `redeem` function. The function performs a transfer of funds to both the contract owner and the caller. If the contract balance is too large, it can exceed the gas limit and cause the transaction to fail.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should consider using the `transfer` function instead of `msg.sender.transfer(this.balance)` to limit the amount of gas used. Additionally, you can use the `send` function instead of `transfer` to handle the failure gracefully and avoid the transaction from reverting completely.

Here's an example of how you can modify the `redeem` function:

function redeem() public payable {
    if (msg.value >= minEligibility) {
        if (!Owner.send(this.balance)) {
            revert(); // handle failure gracefully
        }
        if (!msg.sender.send(this.balance)) {
            revert(); // handle failure gracefully
        }
    }
}

Please note that this is just one possible solution, and you may need to adapt it based on your specific requirements.
