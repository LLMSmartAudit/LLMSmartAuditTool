 Lack of Gas Limit Considerations.

Lack of Gas Limit Considerations
'''
The contract does not consider the gas limit when executing the `sendToWinner()` and `withdrawLeftOver()` functions. This can lead to out-of-gas errors and failed transactions if the gas limit is exceeded during the execution of these functions.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should consider implementing a gas limit check before executing any potentially gas-consuming operations. This can be done by using the `gasleft()` function to check the remaining gas and comparing it against a predefined threshold. If the remaining gas is below the threshold, the function should revert the transaction to prevent out-of-gas errors.

Here's an example of how you can implement a gas limit check:

function sendToWinner() public {
    require(!payedOut);
    require(gasleft() > gasThreshold); // Add a gas limit check
    winner.send(winAmount);
    payedOut = true;
}

function withdrawLeftOver() public {
    require(payedOut);
    require(gasleft() > gasThreshold); // Add a gas limit check
    msg.sender.send(this.balance);
}
