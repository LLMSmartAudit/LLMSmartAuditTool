Ideas:
 To enhance the security and functionality of the ERC20FlashMintUpgradeable contract, we suggest implementing a reentrancy guard to prevent attacks, adding a fee structure for flash loans to prevent abuse and generate revenue, ensuring consistent token validation across all relevant functions, improving error messages for better debugging, and ensuring thorough testing and auditing processes are in place. Additionally, consider setting a cap for maximum flash loan amounts and documenting intended use cases for clarity.
