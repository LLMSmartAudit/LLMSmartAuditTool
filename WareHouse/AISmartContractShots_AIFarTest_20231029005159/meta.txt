 Lack of Gas Limit Considerations.

Lack of Gas Limit Considerations
'''
The provided smart contract does not consider the gas limit when executing the `send` function in the `withdrawBalance` function. This can lead to out-of-gas errors and failed transactions if the gas limit is not sufficient to complete the transaction.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use the `transfer` function instead of `send`. The `transfer` function automatically checks for the available gas and reverts the transaction if there is not enough gas. Additionally, it is important to handle any errors that may occur during the transaction to prevent unexpected behavior.

Here is the updated code with the recommended mitigation:

pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract SendBack {
    mapping (address => uint) userBalances;

    function withdrawBalance() {
        uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
        userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
        msg.sender.transfer(amountToWithdraw);
    }
}
