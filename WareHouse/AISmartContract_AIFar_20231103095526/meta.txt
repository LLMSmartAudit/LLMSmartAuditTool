Ideas:
 Implementing error handling, additional checks, a whitelist of trusted addresses, and logging events in the "ReturnValue" contract can enhance its safety and functionality. This will involve modifying the "callchecked" function to provide more detailed error messages or failure conditions, enforcing the whitelist of trusted addresses for the "callee" parameter, and adding events or logging to track and monitor the contract's behavior.
