Ideas:
 Implementing a multi-signature wallet mechanism for added security in transactions. This will require multiple signatures from authorized parties to execute critical functions like withdrawing funds or executing arbitrary calls to other contracts. By implementing a multi-signature wallet, we can ensure that no single individual has complete control over these actions, reducing the risk of unauthorized or malicious activities.
