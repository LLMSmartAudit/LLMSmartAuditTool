VULNERABILITY NAME or TYPE
'''
Denial of Service (DoS) due to Block Gas Limit
'''

DETAILED DESCRIPTION of the vulnerability, AND recommended mitigation/fix with no upgrade code
'''
The contract contains a loop in the `pay` function that iterates over the `queue` array. This loop does not have a fixed number of iterations and can potentially iterate over a large number of elements. If the number of elements in the `queue` array is large, the `pay` function could exceed the block gas limit, causing the transaction to fail. This could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if an attacker intentionally fills the `queue` with a large number of deposits.

To mitigate this, the contract should limit the number of iterations in the loop to a fixed number. This can be done by introducing a limit variable that is set to a reasonable value. The loop should then only iterate up to this limit. Additionally, the contract should include a mechanism to handle any remaining elements in the `queue` that were not processed in the current transaction. This could be done by storing the index of the last processed element and starting the next transaction from this index.
