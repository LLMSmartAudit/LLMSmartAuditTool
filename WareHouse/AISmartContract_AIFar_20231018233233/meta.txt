Ideas:
 Implementing the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks and adding input validation checks to ensure the recipient address is valid and not a contract address are two crucial improvements for the provided Solidity contract code. The modified `withdrawReward` function incorporates these enhancements, ensuring that the reward balance is set to zero before performing the external transfer and validating the recipient address. The `isContract` function is introduced to check if an address is a contract or an externally owned account. These modifications significantly enhance the contract's security.
