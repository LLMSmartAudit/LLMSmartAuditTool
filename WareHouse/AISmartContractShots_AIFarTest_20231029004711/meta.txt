 Lack of Gas Limit Considerations.

Lack of Gas Limit Considerations
'''
The provided smart contract does not consider the gas limit when executing the `send` function in the `withdrawBalance` function. This can lead to out-of-gas errors and failed transactions if the gas limit is exceeded during the execution of the `send` function.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use the `transfer` function instead of `send` as it automatically limits the gas usage to 2,300 gas units. Additionally, it is important to handle any potential exceptions or errors that may occur during the execution of the `transfer` function to ensure proper error handling and contract functionality.

Here is the updated code with the recommended changes:

pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract SendBack {
    mapping (address => uint) userBalances;

    function withdrawBalance() {
        uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
        userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
        require(msg.sender.transfer(amountToWithdraw));
    }
}
