Ideas:
  To enhance the security and functionality of the `CompoundMultiOracle` contract, consider the following improvements:

1. Implement a robust RBAC system using OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` for the `auth` modifier to ensure that only authorized addresses can call sensitive functions.
2. Add input validation to check for zero addresses in the `setSources` function to prevent setting invalid oracle sources.
3. Introduce redundancy in oracle sources by using multiple oracles and implementing an aggregation method (average or median) to mitigate the risk of a single oracle failure.
4. Ensure there is no division by zero in the `peek` and `get` functions when calculating the `value`.
5. Replace `block.timestamp` with a more reliable time source if the `updateTime` is critical to the contract's logic to prevent miner manipulation.
6. If the `SCALE_FACTOR` is not intended for future use, remove it to simplify the contract and save gas.
7. Consider emitting additional events for other critical actions or state changes to improve transparency and traceability.
8. Review the visibility of the `_peek` function and change it to `internal` if there is no need for it to be overridden.
9. Enhance revert messages with additional details, such as the base or kind that caused the error, to aid in debugging.
10. Optimize gas usage by caching repeated calculations within functions.
11. Separate the contract into more modular components to isolate oracle interaction logic from source management logic.
12. Add comprehensive inline and NatSpec comments to document the contract's functionality and usage.
13. Thoroughly review all inherited interfaces and contracts (`IOracle`, `AccessControl`, and `Constants`) for additional security considerations.
14. Ensure extensive testing coverage with unit and integration tests, and have the contract audited by a reputable security firm to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
