 NO Gas Limit.

Upon reviewing the provided contract code, I did not find any instances of vulnerabilities related to Gas Limit. The contract appears to be relatively simple and straightforward, with a focus on initializing a variable and allowing for self-destruction of the contract. However, it is recommended to include appropriate access modifiers for the functions in the contract and specify the return type of the `run` function for clarity and adherence to best practices.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
