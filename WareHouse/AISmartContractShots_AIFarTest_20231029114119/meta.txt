 Lack of Gas Limit Considerations.

Lack of Gas Limit Considerations
'''
The provided smart contract does not consider the gas limit when executing the `withdrawAll` function. This function transfers the entire balance of the contract to the specified recipient. However, if the contract holds a large amount of funds, the execution of this function can consume a significant amount of gas, potentially exceeding the block gas limit and causing the transaction to fail.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement a gas limit check before executing the `transfer` function. This check ensures that the gas required for the transaction does not exceed a certain limit, preventing out-of-gas errors. Additionally, it is advisable to provide a fallback mechanism to handle failed transactions and revert the state changes if necessary.

Here is an updated version of the `withdrawAll` function with the recommended mitigation:

function withdrawAll(address _recipient) public {
    require(tx.origin == owner);
    require(gasleft() >= 200000); // Set an appropriate gas limit
    _recipient.transfer(this.balance);
}
