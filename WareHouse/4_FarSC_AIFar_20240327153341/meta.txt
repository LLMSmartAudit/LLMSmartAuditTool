Ideas:
  To enhance the security and functionality of the provided proxy contract, we recommend the following improvements: Implement a specific gas limit for `delegatecall` to prevent gas-related issues, introduce a secure upgrade mechanism with a multi-signature wallet or governance system for the implementation address, ensure proper initialization and compatibility checks for new implementations, include event logging for increased transparency, establish robust access control to restrict sensitive operations, utilize the "unstructured storage" pattern to avoid storage collisions, and conduct professional security audits to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
