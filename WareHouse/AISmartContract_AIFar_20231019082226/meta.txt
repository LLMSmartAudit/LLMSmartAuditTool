pragma solidity ^0.5.0;contract Reentrancy_insecure {mapping (address => uint) private userBalances;function withdrawBalance() public {uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];(bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)(""); againrequire(success);userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;}}

Ideas:
 Implementing a check-and-update pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
contract Reentrancy_insecure {
    mapping (address => uint) private userBalances;
    function withdrawBalance() public {
        uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
        userBalances[msg.sender] = 0; // Update balance before transfer
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }
}
```

Implementing a modifier to restrict the withdrawal function to only allow one withdrawal per user per transaction:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
contract Reentrancy_insecure {
    mapping (address => uint) private userBalances;
    mapping (address => bool) private hasWithdrawn;
    modifier onlyOncePerTransaction() {
        require(!hasWithdrawn[msg.sender], "Already withdrawn in this transaction");
        _;
    }
    function withdrawBalance() public onlyOncePerTransaction {
        uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
        userBalances[msg.sender] = 0; // Update balance before transfer
        hasWithdrawn[msg.sender] = true; // Mark user as withdrawn in this transaction
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }
}
```
