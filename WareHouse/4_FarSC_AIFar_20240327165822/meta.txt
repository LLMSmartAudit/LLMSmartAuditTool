Ideas:
 Certainly, let's refine the suggestions:

1. **Prevent Underflow and Overflow**: Implement checks to prevent underflow and overflow. This can be done using the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations which automatically checks for these issues.
   
2. **Update Deprecated Functions**: Replace the `suicide` function with `selfdestruct` to ensure compatibility with newer versions of Solidity and to follow best practices.

3. **Implement Ownership Controls**: Define an `owner` state variable and create an `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict access to sensitive functions like `kill`. This ensures that only the authorized user can perform critical actions.

4. **Clarify Event Emission Logic**: Review the logic for emitting events to ensure that they are emitted in a clear and predictable manner, preferably in public or external functions that change the state of the contract.

5. **Expand Contract Functionality**: Add functions that allow for the management and handling of hashes, such as adding, retrieving, and verifying hashes, to provide the intended functionality of the contract.

6. **Specify Compiler Version Pragma**: Use a version range for the Solidity compiler pragma to prevent the contract from compiling with versions that are too new and potentially incompatible or contain unfixed bugs.

7. **Add Input Validation**: Ensure that all inputs to functions are validated, for example, checking that the `digestSize` is within a reasonable range for hash functions.

8. **Implement Event Arguments Checks**: Add checks to ensure that the arguments for events, such as `hashFunction` and `digestSize`, are within valid ranges before emitting the events.

Once these enhancements are implemented, the contract will be more secure, functional, and aligned with best practices in Solidity development. Shall we finalize these points into our enhancement proposal?
