 Lack of Gas Limit Considerations.

Lack of Gas Limit Considerations
'''
The provided smart contract does not consider the gas limit when executing the `withdrawBalance()` function. This function retrieves the balance of the user and sends it back to the user's address. However, if the user's balance is too high, the contract may run out of gas during the execution of the `send()` function, resulting in a failed transaction.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should consider implementing a gas limit check before executing the `send()` function. This can be done by using the `gasleft()` function to check the remaining gas and comparing it against a predefined gas limit. If the remaining gas is below the gas limit, you can revert the transaction or provide an appropriate error message to the user.

Here's an example of how you can implement the gas limit check:

pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract SendBack {
    mapping (address => uint) userBalances;

    function withdrawBalance() {
        uint amountToWithdraw = userBalances[msg.sender];
        userBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
        
        if (gasleft() < gasLimit) {
            revert("Gas limit exceeded");
        }
        
        msg.sender.send(amountToWithdraw);
    }
}

Please note that you need to define the `gasLimit` variable and set an appropriate value based on your specific requirements and gas cost estimations.
