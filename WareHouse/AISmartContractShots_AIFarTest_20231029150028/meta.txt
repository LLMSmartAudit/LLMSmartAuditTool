Upon reviewing the provided contract code, I have identified a potential vulnerability related to Lack of Gas Limit Considerations.

VULNERABILITY: Lack of Gas Limit Considerations
'''
DETAILED DESCRIPTION: The contract code does not consider the gas limit when executing the `resetInvestment` function. This function performs a `send` operation to transfer funds to the `lastInvestor` and `owner` addresses. However, if the contract balance is too high, the `send` operation may consume more gas than the block gas limit allows, resulting in a failed transaction.

RECOMMENDED MITIGATION/FIX: To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use the `transfer` function instead of `send` for transferring funds. The `transfer` function automatically limits the gas usage to prevent out-of-gas errors. Additionally, it is important to consider the gas limit when performing any operations that involve transferring funds or executing potentially expensive operations.

Please note that implementing proper gas limit considerations may require additional code changes and careful consideration of the contract's requirements and desired functionality.
