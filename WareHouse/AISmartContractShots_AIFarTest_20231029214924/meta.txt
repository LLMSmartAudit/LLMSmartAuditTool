Ideas:
NO Gas Limit.

Upon reviewing the provided smart contract code, I did not identify any vulnerabilities related to Gas Limit. The contract includes appropriate gas limit considerations and does not have any potential denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities.

However, it's important to note that this review focused solely on Gas Limit vulnerabilities. There may be other security considerations that need to be addressed, such as input validation, access control, or secure handling of sensitive data. If you would like a comprehensive security review of the contract, please let me know, and I will be happy to assist you further.
