Ideas:
After reviewing the provided contract code, I have identified a potential vulnerability related to Reentrancy attacks.

In the "Collect" function, the line `if (msg.sender.call.value(_am)())` is used to transfer the specified amount of funds to the caller. However, this line of code allows the caller to execute arbitrary code in the receiving contract before the transfer is completed.

This creates a potential vulnerability where an attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the "Collect" function repeatedly, reentering the contract and draining its balance.

To mitigate this vulnerability, I recommend using the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern. This pattern involves performing all necessary checks and updating the contract's state before interacting with external contracts.

Here's an example of how the "Collect" function can be modified to prevent reentrancy attacks:

```solidity
function Collect(uint _am) public payable {
    if (balances[msg.sender] >= MinSum && balances[msg.sender] >= _am && balances[msg.sender] - _am <= balances[msg.sender]) {
        balances[msg.sender] -= _am;
        Log.AddMessage(msg.sender, _am, "Collect");
        require(msg.sender.call.value(_am)());
    }
}
```

With this modification, the state of the contract is updated before the external call, ensuring that the contract's balance is adjusted correctly and preventing reentrancy attacks.

Please note that this is just one potential vulnerability that I have identified. It is important to conduct a thorough security audit of the entire contract code to identify and address any other potential vulnerabilities.
