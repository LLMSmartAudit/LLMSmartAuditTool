 Lack of Gas Limit Considerations.

Lack of Gas Limit Considerations
'''
The provided contract code does not consider the gas limit when executing the function. This can lead to out-of-gas errors and failed transactions if the function performs a while loop that iterates a large number of times. In this case, the function does not have a while loop, but it performs a check using the modulo operator (%), which can potentially result in a large number of iterations depending on the value of "now".

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to add a gas limit check before executing any potentially expensive operations. This can be done by using the "gasleft()" function to check the remaining gas and comparing it with a predefined threshold. If the remaining gas is below the threshold, the function should revert or return an error to prevent out-of-gas errors.

Here is an example of how the gas limit check can be implemented:

function () public payable {
    require(msg.value == 10 ether);
    require(now != pastBlockTime);
    pastBlockTime = now;

    if (now % 15 == 0) {
        require(gasleft() >= 100000); // Gas limit check
        msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
    }
}
