Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: ###pragma solidity ^0.4.0;contract TimeLock {mapping(address => uint) public balances;mapping(address => uint) public lockTime;function deposit() public payable {balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;lockTime[msg.sender] = now + 1 weeks;}function increaseLockTime(uint _secondsToIncrease) public {lockTime[msg.sender] += _secondsToIncrease;}function withdraw() public {require(balances[msg.sender] > 0);require(now > lockTime[msg.sender]);uint transferValue = balances[msg.sender];balances[msg.sender] = 0;msg.sender.transfer(transferValue);}}###.]

Sure! Let's review the TimeLock smart contract provided by the customer.

Upon examination, there seem to be a few areas in which we can provide enhancements to the contract:

<INFO> After reviewing the TimeLock smart contract, and identifying areas where enhancements can be made, our primary suggestion is to improve the security measures within the contract. 

Below are the specific enhancements we recommend:
1. Modify access permissions: Currently, anyone can deposit or specify an increased lock duration for any account. To increase security, we recommend adding a modifier that restricts these actions only to the account holder.

2. Implement account only withdrawals: To mitigate potential security risks, it may be preferable to change the `withdraw` functionality to solely allow the sender's own account to make withdrawals, rather than allowing withdrawals from any account with a balance.

3.
