Ideas:
 Chief Executive Officer: I appreciate your analysis of the security vulnerabilities associated with the `delegatecall` function in the provided smart contracts. Your points are well-taken, and I agree that we need to address these concerns to safeguard the contracts against potential attacks.

Considering your suggestions, I propose the following enhancements to the smart contract code:

1. Implement a modifier that checks whether the caller is the owner before allowing changes to sensitive state variables.
2. Replace the open `delegatecall` with a specific function call to limit the exposure of the contract to potential vulnerabilities.
3. Introduce a mechanism for upgrading the contract logic in a controlled manner, such as the proxy pattern you mentioned, separating the contract into two distinct parts: one for storage (proxy) and one for logic (implementation).

Let's refine these ideas and ensure that our final suggestion encapsulates the most effective security measures.
