According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input. it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise.".

Modality: "function".

Programming Language: "Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

Here is a new customer's task: triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input. it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The main file for this task will be named `triples_sum_to_zero.py`. It will contain the main function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a list of integers as input and returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise.

Here is the content of the `triples_sum_to_zero.py` file:

```python
'''

    Args:
        nums (list): List of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if there are three distinct elements that sum to zero, False otherwise.
    """
    n = len(nums)
    if n < 3:
        return False

    nums.sort()

    for i in range(n-2):
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
            continue

        left = i + 1
        right = n - 1

        while left < right:
            total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
            if total == 0:
                return True
            elif total < 0:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1

    return False
```

This file contains the `triples_sum_to_zero` function that checks if there are three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero. It first checks if the length of the list is less than 3, in which case it returns False. Then, it sorts the list in ascending order. It uses a nested loop to iterate through all possible combinations of three elements. It skips duplicate elements to ensure distinct elements are considered. If the sum of the three elements is zero, it returns True. If no such combination is found, it returns False.

Next, we need to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the user to interact with the program. We will use the tkinter library in Python to create a simple GUI.

Create a new file named `gui.py` with the following content:

```python
'''
This file contains the graphical user interface (GUI) for the triples_sum_to_zero program.
'''

import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox
from triples_sum_to_zero import triples_sum_to_zero

    nums = [int(num) for num in nums.split()]

# Create the main window

window.title("Triples Sum to Zero")

# Create the input label and entry field

label.pack()
entry = tk.Entry(window)
entry.pack()

# Create the Check Sum button
button = tk.Button(window, text="Check Sum", command=check_sum)
